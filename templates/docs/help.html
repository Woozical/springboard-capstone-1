        Add link URLs to the text area in the control panel, then click the large link button to add them to your repo.
        You can input multiple URLs at once, just separate them on a new line before clicking the link button.
        When submitting your links, they will be instantly added to your repository list on the left. We will try to
        grab some metadata about your URLs and fill out your entries accordingly, but this may take a few seconds.

        Below the link button are two buttons to add a text box and divider, respectively.
        Text boxes are useful for providing instructions or for when a link needs a more verbose description.
        Dividers are useful for separating or categorizing entries.
        Both text boxes and dividers can be used to link to URLs.

        Changes to your repository are not automatically saved to the server. Whenever you have unsaved changes on your
        repository, the save button will be yellow. If you make any mistakes, remember that you can always refresh the
        page without saving your changes first.
        Next to the save button are buttons to edit your repository's information (i.e. title, description, privacy mode), or to
        delete your repository entirely.

        Your entries can be re-sorted using the up and down carets to the left of each entry.
        Each entry's information can be edited by clicking on the gear icon.
        Here you can manually set an entry's image preview, or give it a rating to denote its importance.<br>
        You can quickly remove entries from your repository by holding down the CONTROL key while clicking on the gear icon. <br>
